John/NNP Grisham/NNP ,/, of/IN legal/JJ thriller/NN fame/NN ,/, has/VBZ attempted/VBN a/DT pastoral/JJ memoir/NN with/IN his/PRP$ recent/JJ book/NN ,/, A/DT Painted/NNP House/NNP ./.
I/PRP read/VBP the/DT book/NN cover/NN to/TO cover/VB ,/, enjoying/VBG it/PRP well/RB enough/RB in/IN spots/NNS ,/, but/CC wincing/VBG in/IN others/NNS ,/, where/WRB Grisham/NNP just/RB didn/JJ \/NN x92t/NN seem/VBP to/TO have/VB the/DT skills/NNS to/TO convincingly/RB carry/VB the/DT story/NN ./.
I/PRP will/MD apologize/VB in/IN advance/NN if/IN I/PRP make/VBP any/DT errors/NNS in/IN this/DT review/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT book/NN was/VBD a/DT library/NN loan/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP since/IN returned/VBN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB a/DT book/NN I/PRP need/VBP to/TO own/VB for/IN my/PRP$ personal/JJ collection/NN ./.
Narrated/VBN by/IN 7/CD year/NN old/JJ Luke/NNP ,/, A/DT Painted/NNP House/NNP ,/, is/VBZ the/DT tale/NN of/IN one/CD cotton/NN picking/VBG season/NN for/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN Arkansas/NNP sharecroppers/NNS ./.
Like/IN the/DT young/JJ boy/NN in/IN Grisham/NNP \/CD x92s/NNS The/DT Client/NNP ,/, Luke/NNP seems/VBZ much/RB older/JJR than/IN his/PRP$ years/NNS ,/, and/CC speaks/VBZ quite/RB unlike/IN any/DT 7/CD year/NN old/JJ I/PRP have/VBP encountered/VBN ./.
While/IN Grisham/NNP constructs/NNS decent/JJ plots/NNS ,/, Elmore/NNP Leonard/NNP needn/NN \/CD x92t/NN worry/NN about/IN his/PRP$ status/NN as/IN dialogue/NN writer/NN supreme/NN ./.
I/PRP was/VBD also/RB perplexed/VBN by/IN an/DT early/JJ description/NN in/IN the/DT book/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD used/VBN on/IN the/DT book/NN jacket/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT cotton/NN had/VBD grown/VBN to/TO the/DT father/NN \/CD x92s/NNS waist/NN ,/, AND/CC over/IN Luke/NNP \/NNP x92s/NNPS head/NN ./.
I/PRP actually/RB took/VBD my/PRP$ soon-to-be/JJ 5/CD year/NN old/JJ daughter/NN to/TO see/VB where/WRB she/PRP stood/VBD when/WRB placed/VBN beside/IN me/PRP ./.
Nearly/RB to/TO my/PRP$ waist/NN ./.
So/RB ,/, apparently/RB Luke/NNP was/VBD pretty/RB short/JJ or/CC his/PRP$ dad/NN was/VBD pretty/RB tall/JJ ./.
I/PRP know/VBP this/DT is/VBZ nit-picky/JJ ,/, but/CC if/IN Grisham/NNP is/VBZ going/VBG for/IN memorable/JJ descriptions/NNS ,/, using/VBG questionable/JJ details/NNS is/VBZ an/DT iffy/JJ way/NN to/TO start/VB ./.
Living/VBG with/IN his/PRP$ mother/NN and/CC father/NN on/IN his/PRP$ grandparents/NNS \/VBP x92/NN farm/NN ,/, young/JJ Luke/NNP shares/NNS the/DT annual/JJ routines/NNS related/VBN to/TO the/DT cotton/NN harvest/NN ./.
Luke/NNP watches/VBZ his/PRP$ grandfather/NN Pappy/NNP recruit/VB laborers/NNS for/IN the/DT harvest/NN ,/, beginning/VBG with/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN hill/NN people/NNS (/-LRB- a/DT nice/JJ way/NN of/IN saying/VBG hillbilly/RB )/-RRB- ,/, the/DT Spruill/NNP \/CD x92s/NNS ,/, and/CC migrant/JJ Mexicans/NNPS ./.
The/DT Spruill/NNP \/CD x92s/NNS are/VBP a/DT ragged/JJ bunch/NN ,/, straight/RB out/IN of/IN Steinbeck/NNP ,/, and/CC the/DT Mexicans/NNPS are/VBP ,/, well/RB ,/, Mexicans/NNPS ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP \/JJ x96/NN according/VBG to/TO Grisham/NNP ,/, they/PRP pick/VBP cotton/NN without/IN complaint/NN ,/, enjoy/VB a/DT lively/JJ game/NN of/IN baseball/NN ,/, and/CC help/VB paint/VB a/DT house/NN ./.
A/DT good-natured/JJ bunch/NN of/IN gringos/NNS ,/, except/IN for/IN the/DT switchblade/NN brandishing/VBG one/CD called/VBN Cowboy/NNP ./.
Thus/RB begins/VBZ a/DT summer/NN full/JJ of/IN adventure/NN ,/, the/DT likes/NN of/IN which/WDT I/PRP have/VBP yet/RB to/TO see/VB in/IN all/DT of/IN my/PRP$ 38/CD years/NNS ./.
Luke/NNP is/VBZ required/VBN to/TO keep/VB so/RB many/JJ secrets/NNS ,/, he/PRP will/MD undoubtedly/RB be/VB a/DT therapist/NN \/CD x92s/NNS field/NN day/NN in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
The/DT Spruill/NNP \/CD x92s/NNS have/VBP brought/VBN along/RP a/DT psychotic/JJ behemoth/NN named/VBN Hank/NNP ,/, who/WP murders/NNS a/DT young/JJ punk/NN in/IN a/DT fight/NN ,/, during/IN a/DT Saturday/NNP night/NN outing/VBG into/IN town/NN ./.
Luke/NNP witnesses/NNS the/DT violence/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN ,/, and/CC must/MD not/RB talk/VB about/IN it/PRP for/IN fear/NN that/IN all/PDT the/DT Spruill/NNP \/CD x92s/NNS will/MD leave/VB before/IN the/DT cotton/NN is/VBZ harvested/VBN ./.
Also/RB in/IN the/DT Spruill/NNP clan/NN is/VBZ a/DT hot/JJ hillbilly/JJ chick/NN ,/, Tally/NNP (/-LRB- does/VBZ that/IN rhyme/NN with/IN Sally/NNP or/CC Paulie/NNP ?/. )/-RRB-
,/, who/WP Luke/NNP lusts/VBZ after/IN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/IN seems/VBZ a/DT bit/NN unlike/IN a/DT 7/CD year/NN old/JJ ./.
He/PRP watches/VBZ her/PRP$ bathing/NN nude/JJ in/IN the/DT creek/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP half-expected/VBD him/PRP to/TO have/VB his/PRP$ first/JJ sexual/JJ encounter/NN !/.
This/DT is/VBZ all/DT disconcerting/VBG to/TO the/DT reader/NN \/CD x96/NN while/IN a/DT touch/NN of/IN romance/NN might/MD have/VB been/VBN nice/JJ for/IN the/DT story/NN ,/, Grisham/NNP made/VBD Luke/NNP 7/CD instead/RB of/IN ,/, say/VB ,/, 15/CD ./.
Fans/NNS of/IN John/NNP Grisham/NNP will/MD no/DT doubt/NN want/VBP to/TO read/VB this/DT ./.
A/DT Painted/NNP House/NNP is/VBZ supposedly/RB based/VBN on/IN some/DT of/IN Grisham/NNP \/CD x92s/NNS childhood/NN experiences/NNS ./.
I/PRP found/VBD the/DT book/NN as/IN entertaining/JJ but/CC no/RB better/JJR than/IN the/DT average/JJ movie/NN shown/VBN on/IN cable/NN \/CD x92s/NNS Lifetime/NN channel/NN ./.
Here/RB are/VBP some/RB better/JJR titles/NNS for/IN your/PRP$ summer/NN reading/NN list/NN ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ humble/JJ opinion/NN ./.
John/NNP Grisham/NNP ,/, consciously/RB or/CC unconsciously/RB ,/, borrowed/VBN a/DT little/JJ flavoring/NN from/IN some/DT of/IN these/DT better/JJR works/NNS to/TO spice/NN up/RP his/PRP$ cotton/NN tale/NN ./.
1/LS )/-RRB- The/DT Summer/NN of/IN \/CD x9242/NN ,/, Herman/NNP Raucher/NNP ./.
My/PRP$ all-time/JJ favorite/JJ book/NN ./.

5/LS )/-RRB- Dandelion/NNP Wine/NNP ,/, Ray/NNP Bradbury/NNP ./.
I/PRP read/VBP this/DT one/CD a/DT long/JJ time/NN ago/RB ,/, but/CC there/EX are/VBP scenes/NNS of/IN an/DT idyllic/JJ but/CC unusual/JJ boyhood/NN summer/NN that/IN I/PRP still/RB recall/VBP ./.
Publishing/NN a/DT novel/NN is/VBZ a/DT brilliant/JJ thing/NN ,/, and/CC something/NN I/PRP dream/VBP of/IN doing/VBG one/CD day/NN ./.
But/CC ,/, as/IN with/IN any/DT form/NN of/IN art/NN ,/, when/WRB you/PRP experience/VBP the/DT masters/NNS (/-LRB- the/DT above/JJ 5/CD )/-RRB- ,/, it/PRP makes/VBZ the/DT Grishams/NNP of/IN the/DT world/NN seem/VBP less/JJR spectacular/JJ ./.
I/PRP get/VBP the/DT feeling/NN from/IN Grisham/NNP ,/, Clark/NNP ,/, King/NNP and/CC others/NNS ,/, that/IN quantity/NN has/VBZ become/VBN more/RBR important/JJ than/IN quality/NN ./.
I/PRP \/VBP x92ll/NN take/VB one/CD Herman/NNP Raucher/NNP over/IN ten/CD John/NNP Grishams/NNP any/DT day/NN ./.
