I/PRP was/VBD gone/VBN ,/, just/RB needed/VBD some/DT time/NN away/RB ./.
Ready/JJ ???/NN
Thanksgiving/NNP dinner/NN ,/, my/PRP$ older/JJR sister/NN Colleen/NNP tells/VBZ me/PRP the/DT new/JJ James/NNP Patterson/NNP book/NN featuring/VBG my/PRP$ beloved/JJ Dr./NNP Detective/NNP Alex/NNP Cross/NNP came/VBD out/RP Tuesday/NNP ./.
I/PRP had/VBD no/DT idea/NN !!!/IN
The/DT next/JJ day/NN ,/, BLACK/NNP FRIDAY/NNP !!!/IN
,/, I/PRP ,/, being/VBG the/DT brave/VBP ,/, adventurous/JJ ,/, and/CC loopy/JJ chick/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP ,/, ran/VBD to/TO the/DT mall/NN !!!!!!!!/CD
I/PRP bought/VBD a/DT few/JJ gifts/NNS ,/, and/CC one/CD for/IN myself/PRP ,/, which/WDT kinda/VBP seems/VBZ selfish/JJ ,/, it/PRP being/VBG the/DT season/NN of/IN GIVING/NNP !/.
./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP rationalized/VBD !/.
Yes/UH ,/, I/PRP sooo/VBP wanted/VBD to/TO read/VB "/`` Violets/NNS are/VBP Blue/NNP ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB NOT/RB just/RB for/IN me/PRP ,/, both/DT of/IN my/PRP$ sisters/NNS want/VBP to/TO read/VB it/PRP too/RB !/.
Therefore/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB selfish/JJ ,/, because/IN it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB JUST/RB for/IN me/PRP .../: but/CC the/DT three/CD of/IN us/PRP :)/NN .../: and/CC on/IN to/TO the/DT review/NN .../: ./.
Violets/NNS are/VBP Blue/NNP ,/, the/DT James/NNP Patterson/NNP novel/NN is/VBZ like/IN many/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ others/NNS starring/VBG the/DT infamous/JJ Alex/NNP Cross/NNP ./.
Many/JJ previous/JJ characters/NNS from/IN prior/JJ books/NNS show/VBP up/RP again/RB ./.
Patterson/NNP ,/, does/VBZ not/RB expect/VB you/PRP to/TO know/VB who/WP they/PRP are/VBP ,/, so/IN he/PRP gives/VBZ background/NN on/IN each/DT ,/, so/RB you/PRP are/VBP n't/RB lost/VBN ,/, if/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ book/NN of/IN his/PRP$ that/IN you/PRP happen/VB to/TO pick/VB up/RP ./.
---/: woohooo/NN Flyers/NNPS just/RB scored/VBN ----/: oops/NNS ,/, sorry/RB ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP watching/VBG tv/NN ./.

This/DT time/NN around/RP ,/, the/DT dead/JJ are/VBP hung/JJ upside/RB down/RB ,/, drained/VBN of/IN most/JJS of/IN their/PRP$ blood/NN ,/, bitten/NN ,/, and/CC bitten/NN ,/, and/CC bitten/NN again/RB ./.
People/NNS are/VBP dying/VBG ,/, all/DT over/IN from/IN these/DT killers/NNS ./.
The/DT case/NN takes/VBZ Alex/NNP to/TO California/NNP where/WRB he/PRP meets/VBZ San/NNP Fransisco/NNP Inspector/NNP Jamilla/NNP Hughs/NNP ,/, where/WRB he/PRP learns/VBZ of/IN the/DT Vampire/NNP theory/NN ,/, where/WRB he/PRP researches/VBZ ,/, and/CC talks/NNS to/TO so/RB called/VBN REAL/NNP Vampires/NNPS ./.
Alex/NNP is/VBZ of/IN course/NN skeptical/JJ ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP ,/, come/VBP on/IN ,/, VAMPIRES/NNP ????/CD
Patterson/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB expect/VB you/PRP to/TO believe/VB in/IN Vampires/NNS ,/, but/CC you/PRP will/MD believe/VB in/IN those/DT that/WDT want/VBP to/TO be/VB vampires/NNS ,/, and/CC live/VB their/PRP$ lives/NNS impersonating/VBG the/DT dark/JJ ,/, fanged/JJ ,/, murderous/JJ creatures/NNS ./.
As/IN if/IN trying/VBG to/TO find/VB the/DT killers/NNS of/IN these/DT brutal/JJ blood/NN draining/VBG attacks/NNS were/VBD n't/RB enough/RB ,/, Alex/NNP is/VBZ being/VBG stalked/VBN ,/, via/IN cell/NN phone/NN by/IN a/DT man/NN that/WDT calls/VBZ himself/PRP the/DT MASTERMIND/NNP ./.

The/DT Mastermind/NNP taunts/NNS him/PRP ,/, and/CC he/PRP is/VBZ always/RB One/CD Step/NN Ahead/NNP ./.
He/PRP knows/VBZ where/WRB Alex/NNP is/VBZ at/IN every/DT moment/NN ,/, and/CC He/PRP wants/VBZ Alex/NNP dead/JJ !/.
When/WRB you/PRP first/RB open/VB the/DT book/NN ,/, reading/VBG the/DT Prologue/NNP ,/, it/PRP grips/NNS you/PRP ,/, right/RB then/RB ,/, right/RB there/RB ,/, so/RB early/RB on/IN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP no/DT choice/NN but/CC to/TO read/VB ,/, quickly/RB ,/, with/IN anticipation/NN ,/, knowing/VBG in/IN your/PRP$ heart/NN that/IN Alex/NNP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB triumphant/JJ !/.
