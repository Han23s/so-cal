I/PRP 've/VBP read/VBN most/JJS of/IN the/DT books/NNS written/VBN by/IN Mary/NNP Higgins/NNP Clark/NNP and/CC have/VBP enjoyed/VBN them/PRP ./.
Before/IN I/PRP Say/VBP Goodbye/NNP is/VBZ her/PRP$ 22nd/JJ book/NN and/CC my/PRP$ least/JJS favorite/NN of/IN all/DT of/IN them/PRP ./.
That/DT does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB enjoy/VB it/PRP ,/, I/PRP just/RB felt/VBD her/PRP$ other/JJ novels/NNS were/VBD much/RB more/RBR exciting/JJ and/CC interesting/JJ ./.
I/PRP read/VBP the/DT back/JJ cover/NN of/IN the/DT book/NN and/CC expected/VBD something/NN completely/RB different/JJ than/IN the/DT story/NN before/IN me/PRP ./.
The/DT synopsis/NN indicated/VBD that/IN Nell/NNP MacDermott/NNP had/VBD lost/VBN her/PRP$ husband/NN ,/, Adam/NNP ,/, when/WRB a/DT bomb/NN blew/VBD up/RP his/PRP$ boat/NN ./.
She/PRP had/VBD so/RB many/JJ unanswered/JJ questions/NNS ./.
When/WRB a/DT woman/NN approached/VBD her/PRP with/IN psychic/JJ powers/NNS claiming/VBG to/TO have/VB contacted/VBN Adam/NNP in/IN the/DT after-life/NN ,/, Nell/NNP agrees/VBZ to/TO try/VB to/TO get/VB the/DT answers/NNS through/IN this/DT medium/NN ./.
This/DT was/VBD n't/RB the/DT story/NN line/NN at/IN all/DT -/: there/EX was/VBD a/DT hint/NN at/IN the/DT paranormal/NN and/CC psychic/JJ abilities/NNS ,/, but/CC only/RB a/DT hint/NN ./.
Maybe/RB Clark/NNP 's/POS publicist/NN was/VBD trying/VBG to/TO draw/VB in/IN those/DT interested/JJ in/IN the/DT paranormal/NN ./.
The/DT story/NN was/VBD more/RBR based/VBN on/IN Nell/NNP trying/VBG to/TO clear/JJ Adam/NNP 's/POS name/NN when/WRB bid/NN rigging/NN and/CC construction/NN scams/NNS are/VBP investigated/VBN by/IN law/NN enforcement/NN agencies/NNS and/CC her/PRP$ husband/NN 's/POS name/NN seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB at/IN the/DT center/NN of/IN it/PRP all/DT ./.
Oh/UH and/CC did/VBD I/PRP mention/VB that/DT Nell/NNP 's/POS grandfather/NN (/-LRB- who/WP raised/VBD her/PRP$ )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT retired/JJ congressman/NN who/WP wants/VBZ his/PRP$ granddaughter/NN to/TO follow/VB in/IN his/PRP$ political/JJ footsteps/NNS ?/.
With/IN the/DT black/JJ cloud/NN hanging/VBG over/IN her/PRP$ dead/JJ husband/NN ,/, Nell/NNP 's/POS political/JJ future/NN is/VBZ very/RB uncertain/JJ ./.
Nell/NNP goes/VBZ on/IN her/PRP$ on/IN sleuthing/NN expedition/NN to/TO try/VB to/TO get/VB answers/NNS and/CC ends/VBZ up/RP getting/VBG more/JJR than/IN she/PRP bargained/VBD for/IN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT race/NN against/IN the/DT clock/NN to/TO save/VB her/PRP ./.
The/DT characters/NNS are/VBP not/RB very/RB well/RB described/VBN ,/, but/CC only/RB vaguely/RB outlined/VBN ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ probably/RB the/DT biggest/JJS detriment/NN to/TO the/DT book/NN -/: there/EX were/VBD so/RB many/JJ support/VBP characters/NNS that/WDT could/MD have/VB made/VBN for/IN some/DT fantastic/JJ subplots/NNS and/CC the/DT opportunities/NNS were/VBD wasted/VBN ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, Nell/NNP 's/POS Great/NNP Aunt/NNP Gert/NNP could/MD have/VB an/DT entire/JJ book/NN devoted/VBN to/TO her/PRP$ whimsical/JJ character/NN ./.
She/PRP 's/VBZ fun/NN ,/, eclectic/JJ and/CC loves/VBZ to/TO explore/VB the/DT supernatural/JJ (/-LRB- did/VBD n't/RB Mary/NNP Higgins/NNP Clark/NNP write/VB an/DT entire/JJ book/NN for/IN another/DT support/NN character/NN with/IN the/DT same/JJ fun/NN characteristics/NNS ?/.
Yep/NNP ,/, remember/VBP The/DT Lottery/NNP Winner/NN ?/. )/-RRB-
./.
Maybe/RB the/DT future/NN will/MD hold/VB a/DT book/NN on/IN Great/JJ Aunt/NNP Gert/NNP ,/, which/WDT should/MD be/VB fun/NN to/TO read/VB ./.
Before/IN I/PRP Say/VBP Goodbye/NNP is/VBZ an/DT average/JJ book/NN ,/, but/CC definitely/RB not/RB on/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN Mary/NNP Higgins/NNP Clark/NNP 's/POS list/NN of/IN great/JJ books/NNS ./.
Before/IN I/PRP Say/VBP Goodbye/NNP leaves/VBZ you/PRP wanting/VBG more/RBR -/: more/JJR character/NN description/NN ,/, more/JJR in-depth/JJ plot/NN ,/, more/JJR subplots/NNS ,/, more/JJR everything/NN !/.
I/PRP 'd/MD suggest/VB it/PRP only/RB if/IN you/PRP 've/VBP read/VBN all/DT of/IN her/PRP$ other/JJ books/NNS ,/, but/CC until/IN then/RB ,/, leave/VBP it/PRP on/IN the/DT library/NN shelf/NN !/.
