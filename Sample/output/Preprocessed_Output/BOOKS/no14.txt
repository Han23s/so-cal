Ah/NN ,/, if/IN only/RB good/JJ writers/NNS could/MD stay/VB at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN their/PRP$ game/NN forever/RB .../: unfortunately/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ n't/RB the/DT case/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ always/RB sad/JJ to/TO see/VB one/CD of/IN your/PRP$ favorite/JJ authors/NNS turn/VBP out/RP a/DT lackluster/JJ book/NN that/WDT seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB written/VBN with/IN a/DT lack/NN of/IN regard/NN for/IN his/PRP$ readers/NNS '/POS intelligence/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN hastily/RB written/VBN and/CC poorly/RB edited/VBN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN with/IN James/NNP Patterson/NNP 's/POS latest/JJS Alex/NNP Cross/NNP thriller/NN ,/, Violets/NNP Are/VBP Blue/JJ ./.
The/DT Premise/NNP Alex/NNP Cross/NNP is/VBZ back/RB as/IN a/DT D.C./NNP detective/NN who/WP again/RB pairs/NNS up/IN with/IN the/DT FBI/NNP to/TO help/VB solve/VB a/DT series/NN of/IN horrific/JJ murders/NNS that/WDT appear/VBP to/TO have/VB been/VBN committed/VBN by/IN vampires/NNS ./.
As/IN he/PRP works/VBZ on/IN the/DT case/NN ,/, he/PRP continues/VBZ to/TO be/VB stalked/VBN by/IN his/PRP$ old/JJ nemesis/NN The/DT Mastermind/NN ./.
Along/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, he/PRP meets/VBZ up/RP with/IN yet/RB another/DT pretty/RB detective/NN who/WP he/PRP begins/VBZ to/TO fall/VB for/IN ,/, leaves/VBZ his/PRP$ family/NN in/IN the/DT lurch/VBP again/RB and/CC again/RB ,/, and/CC does/VBZ pretty/RB much/JJ everything/NN he/PRP 's/VBZ been/VBN doing/VBG in/IN the/DT past/JJ novels/NNS ./.
The/DT Pros/NNS The/DT book/NN is/VBZ written/VBN in/IN traditional/JJ Patterson/NNP style/NN of/IN no/DT frills/NNS ./.
The/DT chapters/NNS are/VBP only/RB two/CD or/CC three/CD pages/NNS apiece/RB ,/, the/DT sentences/NNS are/VBP short/JJ and/CC to/TO the/DT point/NN ./.
Readers/NNS will/MD likely/RB breeze/NN through/IN this/DT one/CD in/IN a/DT day/NN or/CC two/CD ./.
If/IN this/DT were/VBD n't/RB the/DT case/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP a/DT feeling/NN that/IN many/JJ readers/NNS would/MD have/VB given/VBN up/RP before/IN the/DT end/NN due/JJ to/TO boredom/NN ,/, frustration/NN or/CC the/DT maddening/JJ feeling/NN of/IN '/`` What/WP the/DT hell/NN is/VBZ Patterson/NNP thinking/VBG when/WRB he/PRP wrote/VBD this/DT ?/. '/''
while/IN they/PRP read/VBP ./.
The/DT Cons/NNS I/PRP could/MD n't/RB help/VB it/PRP with/IN this/DT book/NN --/: I/PRP ripped/VBD it/PRP apart/RB ./.
I/PRP actually/RB kept/VBD a/DT piece/NN of/IN paper/NN with/IN me/PRP as/IN I/PRP read/VBP because/IN I/PRP found/VBD so/RB many/JJ flaws/NNS ,/, each/DT one/CD nettling/VBG me/PRP so/RB much/RB that/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO write/VB it/PRP down/RP so/RB as/IN not/RB to/TO forget/VB it/PRP in/IN my/PRP$ review/NN ./.
1/LS ./.
This/DT book/NN is/VBZ not/RB well-written/JJ ./.
Although/IN Patterson/NNP got/VBD away/RP with/IN his/PRP$ completely/RB plot-driven/JJ books/NNS before/IN because/IN the/DT plot/NN was/VBD so/RB good/JJ ,/, this/DT plot/NN stumbles/VBZ along/IN and/CC leaves/VBZ you/PRP looking/VBG at/IN the/DT writing/NN ./.
In/IN chapters/NNS that/WDT are/VBP written/VBN from/IN Cross/NNP 's/POS point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, he/PRP uses/VBZ stupid/JJ little/JJ lines/NNS (/-LRB- that/WDT Cross/NNP is/VBZ saying/VBG to/TO himself/PRP )/-RRB- like/IN "/`` Oh/UH ,/, no/DT Kyle/NNP !/.
God/NNP no/DT !/. "/''
and/CC "/`` Kyle/NNP ,/, Kyle/NNP have/VBP mercy/NN on/IN us/PRP "/'' ./.
His/PRP$ descriptions/NNS of/IN people/NNS are/VBP borderline/JJ ridiculous/JJ ./.
After/IN describing/VBG one/CD character/NN ,/, a/DT supposed/VBN vampire/NN 's/POS ,/, appearance/NN ,/, he/PRP adds/VBZ the/DT stupid/JJ line/NN ,/, "/`` He/PRP was/VBD dark/JJ and/CC dangerous/JJ looking/VBG ./. "/''
Another/DT is/VBZ described/VBN as/IN ,/, "/`` The/DT most/RBS sinister/JJ looking/VBG man/NN I/PRP had/VBD ever/RB seen/VBN ./. "/''
And/CC he/PRP has/VBZ an/DT unnerving/JJ habit/NN of/IN hammering/VBG into/IN our/PRP$ skulls/NNS that/WDT pretty/RB women/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB ./.
Every/DT time/NN one/CD woman/NN comes/VBZ into/IN the/DT storyline/NN ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ to/TO mention/VB something/NN about/IN her/PRP$ looks/NNS ,/, even/RB though/IN he/PRP 's/VBZ already/RB described/VBN her/PRP$ as/IN beautiful/JJ ./.
It/PRP would/MD be/VB okay/JJ if/IN it/PRP was/VBD well-done/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB ./.
The/DT lines/NNS ,/, like/IN "/`` She/PRP looked/VBD at/IN me/PRP and/CC she/PRP had/VBD such/JJ beautiful/JJ eyes/NNS "/'' made/VBD me/PRP cringe/VB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT writing/NN of/IN a/DT complete/JJ amateur/JJ ,/, not/RB someone/NN who/WP is/VBZ at/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN his/PRP$ game/NN ,/, as/IN Patterson/NNP should/MD be/VB by/IN now/RB ./.
2/LS ./.
The/DT book/NN is/VBZ full/JJ of/IN inconsistencies/NNS or/CC muddy/JJ areas/NNS ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, a/DT character/NN is/VBZ identified/VBN as/IN Arthur/NNP ,/, and/CC is/VBZ then/RB called/VBN Brody/NNP a/DT few/JJ pages/NNS later/RB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ similar/JJ to/TO something/NN I/PRP found/VBD upsetting/VBG in/IN Roses/NNPS Are/VBP Red/NNP :/: there/EX are/VBP at/IN least/JJS four/CD characters/NNS named/VBN Betsey/NNP ,/, including/VBG a/DT major/JJ character/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRP first/RB started/VBD reading/VBG it/PRP ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT pattern/NN and/CC would/MD be/VB explained/VBN ./.
Nope/UH ./.
Apparently/RB he/PRP just/RB liked/VBD the/DT name/NN Betsey/NNP or/CC kept/VBD forgetting/VBG he/PRP 'd/MD already/RB used/VBN it/PRP ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT product/NN of/IN bad/JJ editing/NN ./.
Come/VB on/IN ,/, James/NNP ,/, you/PRP 're/VBP rollin/VBG '/'' in/IN the/DT dough/NN !/.
Hire/VB a/DT professional/JJ editor/NN !/.
I/PRP 'd/MD be/VB available/JJ for/IN next/JJ to/TO nothing/NN !/.
3/LS ./.
He/PRP takes/VBZ a/DT few/JJ jabs/NNS at/IN his/PRP$ children/NNS that/WDT made/VBD me/PRP mad/JJ ./.
Damon/NNP and/CC Jannie/NNP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN described/VBN as/IN anything/NN but/CC angelic/JJ ,/, but/CC in/IN this/DT book/NN he/PRP refers/VBZ to/TO them/PRP as/IN '/`` the/DT little/JJ creeps/NNS '/POS and/CC says/VBZ Jannie/NNP '/`` can/MD be/VB good/JJ when/WRB she/PRP tries/VBZ '/'' ./.
Huh/NNP ?/.
I/PRP think/VBP anyone/NN would/MD kill/VB to/TO have/VB such/JJ well-behaved/JJ ,/, sweet/JJ children/NNS ,/, as/IN Cross/NNP always/RB has/VBZ seemed/VBN to/TO think/VB in/IN the/DT past/NN ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB any/DT sense/NN !/.
4/LS ./.
The/DT things/NNS Cross/NN does/VBZ ,/, we/PRP 've/VBP seen/VBN book/NN after/IN book/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ getting/VBG very/RB tiresome/JJ and/CC irritating/JJ ./.
He/PRP always/RB gets/VBZ matched/VBN up/RP with/IN an/DT attractive/JJ woman/NN in/IN law/NN enforcement/NN (/-LRB- how/WRB many/JJ of/IN these/DT can/MD there/RB be/VB ?!/IN
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP 've/VBP ever/RB seen/VBN any/DT in/IN real/JJ life/NN !/. )/-RRB-
who/WP he/PRP starts/VBZ falling/VBG for/IN ./.
He/PRP 's/VBZ always/RB saying/VBG he/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO stay/VB home/RB more/RBR often/RB ,/, then/RB runs/VBZ off/RP for/IN days/NNS on/IN end/NN on/IN another/DT case/NN ,/, leaving/VBG his/PRP$ family/NN high/JJ and/CC dry/JJ ./.
This/DT is/VBZ especially/RB irritating/JJ in/IN this/DT book/NN because/IN The/DT Mastermind/NN is/VBZ threatening/VBG his/PRP$ family/NN throughout/IN ,/, yet/RB he/PRP keeps/VBZ leaving/VBG to/TO pursue/VB this/DT case/NN and/CC leaves/VBZ them/PRP alone/RB with/IN their/PRP$ 80-year-old/JJ grandmother/NN and/CC no/DT other/JJ protection/NN !/.
When/WRB the/DT Mastermind/NN calls/VBZ and/CC again/RB threatens/VBZ them/PRP ,/, he/PRP acts/VBZ as/IN if/IN he/PRP 's/VBZ forgotten/VBN they/PRP were/VBD in/IN danger/NN and/CC calls/VBZ in/IN his/PRP$ trusty/JJ buddy/NN Sampson/NNP ,/, who/WP rushes/VBZ over/IN and/CC watches/VBZ out/RP for/IN them/PRP ./.
Come/VB on/IN ,/, Cross/NNP ,/, your/PRP$ kids/NNS '/POS mother/NN was/VBD violently/RB murdered/VBN ,/, you/PRP 're/VBP all/DT they/PRP have/VBP left/VBN and/CC you/PRP 're/VBP taking/VBG off/RP when/WRB they/PRP 're/VBP in/IN danger/NN and/CC endangering/VBG yourself/PRP ?/.
I/PRP 've/VBP always/RB liked/VBN Cross/NNP 's/POS character/NN in/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, but/CC he/PRP got/VBD on/IN my/PRP$ nerves/NNS here/RB ./.
5/CD ./.
The/DT plot/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ the/DT dual/JJ plot/NN of/IN The/DT Mastermind/NN and/CC the/DT vampire/NN killings/NNS ,/, the/DT last/JJ of/IN which/WDT is/VBZ solved/VBN with/IN a/DT '/`` who/WP cares/VBZ ?/. '/''
near/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT book/NN to/TO concentrate/VB on/IN The/DT Mastermind/NN ./.
The/DT dual/JJ plot/NN is/VBZ n't/RB interwoven/VBN enough/RB to/TO make/VB it/PRP work/VB ./.
Plus/NN ,/, where/WRB Patterson/NNP usually/RB writes/VBZ believably/RB about/IN investigations/NNS ,/, this/DT one/CD has/VBZ some/DT very/RB unbelievable/JJ leaps/NNS of/IN faith/NN ./.
Cross/NNP finds/VBZ that/IN some/DT magicians/NNS are/VBP performing/VBG in/IN the/DT areas/NNS that/IN the/DT murders/NNS were/VBD committed/VBN ,/, and/CC ,/, from/IN that/DT alone/RB ,/, they/PRP brand/NN them/PRP the/DT killers/NNS and/CC are/VBP able/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT huge/JJ FBI/NNP team/NN to/TO follow/VB them/PRP ./.
Hmmm/NNP .../: a/DT little/RB more/RBR evidence/NN would/MD be/VB good/JJ here/RB !/.
6/CD ./.
I/PRP was/VBD saving/VBG the/DT best/JJS (/-LRB- and/CC by/IN best/JJS I/PRP mean/VBP most/RBS maddening/JJ )/-RRB- thing/NN for/IN last/JJ ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN Roses/NNPS Are/VBP Red/NNP ,/, The/DT Mastermind/NN is/VBZ revealed/VBN for/IN who/WP he/PRP is/VBZ ./.
In/IN Violets/NNP Are/VBP Blue/JJ ,/, we/PRP go/VBP throughout/IN the/DT entire/JJ book/NN with/IN him/PRP still/RB being/VBG called/VBN The/DT Mastermind/NN as/IN if/IN we/PRP 'd/MD never/RB been/VBN informed/VBN of/IN his/PRP$ identity/NN !/.
The/DT author/NN drops/VBZ clues/NNS to/TO his/PRP$ identity/NN which/WDT are/VBP completely/RB and/CC utterly/RB ridiculous/JJ because/IN WE/NNP ALREADY/NNP KNOW/NNP WHO/WP HE/PRP IS/VBZ !!/CD
What/WP was/VBD he/PRP thinking/VBG here/RB ?/.
Did/VBD he/PRP forget/VB we/PRP knew/VBD who/WP it/PRP was/VBD ?/.
He/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB insulting/JJ our/PRP$ intelligence/NN by/IN bringing/VBG him/PRP back/RB in/IN as/IN an/DT unknown/JJ ,/, thinking/VBG we/PRP 're/VBP not/RB smart/JJ enough/JJ to/TO remember/VB that/IN we/PRP already/RB solved/VBD this/DT little/JJ mystery/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ book/NN !/.
Ugh/RB !/.
To/TO make/VB matter/NN worse/JJR ,/, he/PRP 's/VBZ revealed/VBN in/IN dramatic/JJ fashion/NN like/IN we/PRP 're/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO say/VB ,/, "/`` OH/NN !/.
My/PRP$ goodness/NN ,/, who/WP would/MD have/VB guessed/VBN ?/. "/''
Of/IN course/NN ,/, we/PRP 're/VBP not/RB surprised/JJ and/CC Cross/NN does/VBZ n't/RB seem/VB too/RB surprised/JJ either/CC ./.
Considering/VBG this/DT is/VBZ the/DT plot/NN that/IN he/PRP runs/VBZ with/IN in/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ very/RB disappointing/JJ ./.
Now/RB that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP done/VBN ranting/VBG and/CC raving/VBG (/-LRB- believe/VB me/PRP ,/, I/PRP could/MD have/VB done/VBN more/RBR but/CC I/PRP restrained/VBD myself/PRP )/-RRB- ,/, would/MD I/PRP recommend/VB this/DT book/NN ?/.
Well/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP an/DT Alex/NNP Cross/NNP follower/NN ,/, you/PRP might/MD as/RB well/RB read/VB it/PRP because/IN you/PRP 're/VBP probably/RB already/RB hooked/JJ (/-LRB- as/IN I/PRP am/VBP )/-RRB- and/CC will/MD want/VB to/TO read/VB the/DT next/JJ one/CD (/-LRB- which/WDT there/EX almost/RB certainly/RB will/MD be/VB --/: why/WRB not/RB if/IN he/PRP can/MD get/VB away/RB with/IN marketing/NN this/DT amateurish/JJ crap/NN and/CC still/RB stay/VB on/IN the/DT bestseller/NN list/NN ?/. )/-RRB-
./.
However/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP can/MD get/VB out/RB now/RB ,/, do/VBP it/PRP ./.
Patterson/NNP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB going/VBG down/IN the/DT toilet/NN and/CC bringing/VBG his/PRP$ faithful/NN fans/NNS along/IN with/IN him/PRP ./.
