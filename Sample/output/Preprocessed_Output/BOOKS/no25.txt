A/DT teacher/NN of/IN mine/NN recommended/VBD this/DT book/NN to/TO me/PRP ,/, saying/VBG that/IN all/DT her/PRP$ friends/NNS loved/VBD it/PRP and/CC could/MD n't/RB put/VB it/PRP down/RP ,/, so/RB when/WRB it/PRP came/VBD time/NN to/TO do/VB a/DT critique/NN in/IN her/PRP$ class/NN ,/, I/PRP chose/VBD this/DT book/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Pears/NNP book/NN was/VBD not/RB all/DT that/IN it/PRP was/VBD cracked/VBN up/RP to/TO be/VB ./.
The/DT are/VBP too/RB many/JJ problems/NNS that/WDT drag/VBP this/DT book/NN down/RB ,/, preventing/VBG it/PRP from/IN being/VBG the/DT masterpiece/NN that/IN many/JJ are/VBP claiming/VBG it/PRP to/TO be/VB ./.
First/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ the/DT narration/NN style/NN :/: 4/CD different/JJ narrators/NNS telling/VBG the/DT events/NNS the/DT way/NN they/PRP saw/VBD them/PRP ,/, each/DT fingering/VBG a/DT different/JJ suspect/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT plot/NN had/VBD been/VBN more/RBR gripping/JJ ,/, more/RBR intense/JJ ,/, this/DT would/MD have/VB worked/VBN perfectly/RB ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB ,/, and/CC by/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT third/JJ narrator/NN ,/, I/PRP did/VBD not/RB feel/VB like/IN reader/NN the/DT remaining/VBG two/CD parts/NNS ./.
Then/RB there/EX is/VBZ the/DT narrators/NNS themselves/PRP ./.
Again/RB ,/, this/DT could/MD have/VB been/VBN excellent/JJ ,/, save/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN 2/CD of/IN the/DT narrartors/NNS are/VBP so/RB arrogant/JJ and/CC full/JJ of/IN themselves/PRP that/IN it/PRP made/VBD it/PRP hard/RB for/IN me/PRP to/TO want/VB to/TO keep/VB reading/VBG it/PRP ./.
Finally/RB there/EX was/VBD all/PDT the/DT historical/JJ detail/NN ./.
Mr./NNP Pears/NNP obviously/RB spent/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN researching/VBG to/TO make/VB his/PRP$ book/NN as/IN accurate/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ,/, including/VBG his/PRP$ writing/VBG style/NN ./.
I/PRP commend/VBP him/PRP for/IN that/DT ,/, however/RB the/DT details/NNS he/PRP gives/VBZ are/VBP so/RB numerous/JJ that/IN they/PRP begin/VBP to/TO over/IN shadow/NN the/DT plot/NN ./.
If/IN you/PRP like/IN the/DT history/NN behind/IN what/WP each/DT narrator/NN does/VBZ (/-LRB- i.e./FW the/DT development/NN of/IN science/NN for/IN Da/NN Cola/NN 's/POS tale/NN )/-RRB- then/RB you/PRP will/MD enjoy/VB it/PRP ./.
If/IN you/PRP find/VBP any/DT one/CD of/IN the/DT subjects/NNS offered/VBD (/-LRB- say/VB cryptography/NN )/-RRB- then/RB it/PRP will/MD hinder/VB your/PRP$ enjoyment/NN immensly/RB ./.
I/PRP did/VBD enjoy/VB reading/VBG some/DT of/IN this/DT book/NN ,/, namely/RB Da/NN Cola/NN 's/POS tale/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT final/JJ tale/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT two/CD tales/NNS in/IN the/DT middle/JJ dragged/VBN too/RB much/RB for/IN me/PRP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO really/RB recommend/VB this/DT book/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ another/DT case/NN of/IN hype/NN building/VBG up/RP to/TO nothing/NN
