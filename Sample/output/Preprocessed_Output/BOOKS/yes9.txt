Once/RB upon/IN a/DT time/NN ,/, Stephen/NNP King/NNP wrote/VBD a/DT fairy/NN tale/NN ./.
The/DT eyes/NNS of/IN the/DT Dragon/NNP is/VBZ a/DT truly/RB mesmorizing/JJ and/CC fascinating/JJ story/NN ./.
A/DT fairy/NN tale/NN for/IN adults/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP this/DT could/MD be/VB for/IN older/JJR children/NNS also/RB ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB the/DT customary/JJ violence/NN and/CC language/NN that/IN most/JJS Stephen/NNP King/NNP novels/NNS have/VBP ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB so/RB intense/JJ that/IN it/PRP will/MD frighten/VB you/PRP ./.
"/`` Why/WRB then/RB would/MD I/PRP want/VB to/TO read/VB it/PRP ?/. "/''
You/PRP may/MD be/VB asking/VBG yourself/PRP ./.
Well/UH you/PRP want/VBP to/TO read/VB it/PRP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ novel/JJ ./.
The/DT story/NN is/VBZ set/VBN in/IN an/DT ancient/JJ kingdom/NN called/VBN Delain/NNP ./.
The/DT story/NN centers/NNS around/IN two/CD young/JJ boys/NNS ,/, princes/NNS ,/, the/DT son/NN of/IN the/DT King/NNP ./.
The/DT two/CD brothers/NNS are/VBP Peter/NNP and/CC Thomas/NNP ./.
Peter/NNP ,/, the/DT oldest/JJS ,/, is/VBZ in/IN line/NN to/TO be/VB the/DT next/JJ king/NN ./.
Peter/NNP is/VBZ the/DT perfect/JJ child/NN ./.
Everyone/NN loves/VBZ Peter/NNP ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ handsome/JJ ,/, intelligent/JJ ,/, and/CC caring/NN ./.
Thomas/NNP ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VBZ none/NN of/IN these/DT ./.
He/PRP is/VBZ a/DT lonely/JJ little/JJ boy/NN disliked/VBN and/CC ignored/VBN by/IN all/DT ,/, even/RB his/PRP$ father/NN ./.
Thomas/NNP is/VBZ ignored/VBN by/IN all/DT ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, except/IN for/IN one/CD person/NN :/: the/DT kings/NNS magician/NN Flagg/NNP ./.
Flagg/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN the/DT kingdom/NN for/IN years/NNS ;/: as/RB long/RB as/IN anyone/NN can/MD remember/VB ./.
Before/IN Peter/NNP can/MD become/VB King/NNP ,/, his/PRP$ father/NN is/VBZ murdered/VBN and/CC he/PRP is/VBZ framed/VBN for/IN it/PRP ./.
Since/IN Peter/NNP is/VBZ royalty/NN ,/, he/PRP ca/MD n't/RB be/VB killed/VBN ,/, so/IN he/PRP is/VBZ sent/VBN up/RP into/IN a/DT tower/NN to/TO live/VB out/RP the/DT rest/NN of/IN his/PRP$ life/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ people/NNS he/PRP sees/VBZ are/VBP his/PRP$ guards/NNS ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN Peter/NNP has/VBZ to/TO pass/VB his/PRP$ time/NN is/VBZ his/PRP$ dollhouse/NN that/IN he/PRP played/VBD with/IN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD little/RB ,/, the/DT only/RB other/JJ convience/NN he/PRP was/VBD allowed/VBN was/VBD a/DT napkin/NN to/TO eat/VB with/IN ,/, these/DT he/PRP specially/RB asked/VBD for/IN ./.
Thomas/NNP is/VBZ now/RB the/DT King/NNP ./.
However/RB ,/, Thomas/NNP is/VBZ young/JJ and/CC needs/VBZ someone/NN to/TO help/VB rule/VB the/DT kingdom/NN ./.
Who/WP would/MD that/WDT be/VB ?/.
Why/WRB Flagg/NNP of/IN course/NN ./.
Thomas/NNP knows/VBZ a/DT secret/NN that/WDT could/MD destroy/VB him/PRP and/CC is/VBZ slowly/RB driving/VBG him/PRP mad/JJ ./.
This/DT secret/NN could/MD not/RB only/RB destroy/VB him/PRP ,/, it/PRP would/MD definitely/RB destroy/VB Flagg/NNP ./.
What/WP is/VBZ this/DT secret/NN ?/.
Read/VB the/DT story/NN :/: find/VB out/RP ./.
Will/MD Peter/NNP ever/RB get/VB out/RP ,/, or/CC will/MD he/PRP die/VB in/IN the/DT tower/NN ?/.
Once/RB again/RB read/VB the/DT story/NN find/VB out/RP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP Stephen/NNP King/NNP ./.
The/DT scarier/JJR the/DT story/NN the/DT better/JJR ./.
However/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ just/RB about/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ Stephen/NNP King/NNP story/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB scary/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ enthralling/JJ ./.
For/IN the/DT more/RBR avid/JJ King/NNP readers/NNS out/IN there/RB ;/: check/VB out/RP the/DT reference/NN to/TO this/DT story/NN in/IN the/DT Dark/JJ Tower/NNP series/NN ,/, Roland/NNP mentions/VBZ some/DT of/IN the/DT characters/NNS in/IN this/DT story/NN that/WDT passed/VBD through/IN his/PRP$ town/NN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD young/JJ ./.
For/IN anyone/NN out/IN there/RB who/WP just/RB wants/VBZ to/TO read/VB a/DT good/JJ story/NN ,/, check/VB out/RP this/DT book/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB violent/JJ (/-LRB- well/RB there/EX are/VBP a/DT few/JJ parts/NNS ,/, but/CC not/RB usual/JJ King/NNP violence/NN )/-RRB- ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB vulgar/JJ or/CC sexual/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ just/RB a/DT great/JJ read/NN ./.
I/PRP recommend/VBP this/DT to/TO anyone/NN and/CC everyone/NN ./.
