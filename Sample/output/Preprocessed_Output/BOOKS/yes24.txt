The/DT curator/NN of/IN the/DT Louvre/NNP is/VBZ murdered/VBN in/IN his/PRP$ museum/NN and/CC leaves/VBZ a/DT cryptic/JJ message/NN that/WDT appears/VBZ to/TO point/VB to/TO Robert/NNP Langdon/NNP ,/, a/DT symbologist/NN from/IN Harvard/NNP ,/, as/IN the/DT culprit/NN ./.
The/DT police/NN question/NN Langdon/NNP pretending/VBG to/TO need/VB his/PRP$ expertise/NN but/CC really/RB hoping/VBG to/TO catch/VB him/PRP in/IN a/DT lie/NN ./.
In/IN jumps/VBZ Sophie/NNP Neveu/NNP ,/, a/DT police/NN code/NN breaker/NN who/WP warns/VBZ Langdon/NNP of/IN his/PRP$ danger/NN and/CC forces/NNS him/PRP into/IN an/DT escape/NN from/IN the/DT museum/NN ./.
Turns/VBZ out/RP ,/, Sophie/NNP is/VBZ the/DT murdered/VBN curator/NN \/CD x92s/NNS granddaughter/NN ./.
She/PRP knows/VBZ Langdon/NNP is/VBZ innocent/JJ and/CC needs/VBZ his/PRP$ help/NN to/TO crack/VB the/DT messages/NNS left/VBD to/TO her/PRP$ by/IN her/PRP$ grandfather/NN ./.
What/WDT follows/VBZ is/VBZ a/DT bizarre/JJ romp/VB through/IN Paris/NNP and/CC England/NNP as/IN the/DT unlikely/JJ pair/NN elude/VB the/DT police/NN ,/, a/DT vicious/JJ albino/NN monk/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT true/JJ puppet-master/NN who/WP orchestrated/VBD it/PRP all/DT ./.
The/DT Da/NN Vinci/NNP Code/NNP is/VBZ a/DT classic/JJ thriller/NN with/IN an/DT intellectual/JJ bent/NN ./.
Fact/NN and/CC fiction/NN are/VBP woven/VBN into/IN such/JJ a/DT tight/JJ pattern/NN of/IN conspiracy/NN that/IN it/PRP becomes/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO see/VB where/WRB one/CD ends/NNS and/CC the/DT other/JJ begins/VBZ ./.
It/PRP had/VBD me/PRP running/VBG to/TO my/PRP$ art/NN books/NNS with/IN some/DT astonishment/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT history/NN generally/RB rang/VBD true/JJ ./.
The/DT first/JJ chapter/NN is/VBZ immediately/RB engrossing/VBG and/CC hooks/VBZ the/DT reader/NN from/IN the/DT very/RB first/JJ sentence/NN ./.
The/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT story/NN fails/VBZ somewhat/RB to/TO live/VB up/RP to/TO the/DT potential/JJ offered/VBN in/IN that/DT first/JJ chapter/NN ./.
The/DT plot/NN follows/VBZ a/DT rather/RB traditional/JJ pattern/NN in/IN the/DT modern/JJ thriller/NN ,/, and/CC though/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN again/RB and/CC again/RB (/-LRB- if/IN you/PRP are/VBP around/IN writers/NNS for/IN any/DT length/NN of/IN time/NN you/PRP will/MD discover/VB that/IN there/EX are/VBP no/DT original/JJ plots/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, the/DT perspective/NN offered/VBN in/IN the/DT tale/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ enough/RB to/TO be/VB thoroughly/RB enjoyable/JJ ./.
There/EX are/VBP good/JJ reasons/NNS this/DT novel/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT bestseller/NN list/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP a/DT few/JJ things/NNS that/WDT detracted/VBD from/IN this/DT story/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ was/VBD Brown/JJ \/NN x92s/NNS over-reliance/NN on/IN two/CD constructs/NNS of/IN the/DT fiction/NN writer/NN ./.
When/WRB he/PRP needed/VBD to/TO get/VB across/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN background/NN information/NN (/-LRB- and/CC there/EX is/VBZ an/DT enormous/JJ amount/NN of/IN it/PRP )/-RRB- ,/, he/PRP did/VBD one/CD of/IN two/CD things/NNS ./.
He/PRP either/RB had/VBD Langdon/NNP flashback/NN to/TO a/DT lecture/NN he/PRP gave/VBD in/IN a/DT class/NN somewhere/RB (/-LRB- yawn/NN )/-RRB- or/CC he/PRP had/VBD two/CD or/CC more/JJR characters/NNS discuss/VBP the/DT issue/NN to/TO death/NN ./.
Fiction/NN writers/NNS often/RB refer/VBP to/TO this/DT as/IN \/CD x93maid/NN and/CC butler/NN talk/NN \/CD x94/NN because/IN it/PRP \/VBD x92s/NNS like/IN the/DT maid/NN and/CC the/DT butler/NN discussing/VBG the/DT going/VBG \/CD x92s/NNS on/IN of/IN the/DT family/NN when/WRB they/PRP both/DT know/VBP the/DT going/VBG \/CD x92s/NNS on/IN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ about/RB as/RB thrilling/JJ as/IN watching/VBG paint/NN dry/JJ ./.
The/DT other/JJ thing/NN that/WDT was/VBD a/DT disappointment/NN was/VBD when/WRB the/DT author/NN withheld/VBN information/NN from/IN the/DT reader/NN ./.
I/PRP presume/VBP this/DT was/VBD to/TO create/VB tension/NN ;/: all/DT it/PRP managed/VBD to/TO do/VB was/VBD create/VB aggravation/NN ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, why/WRB keep/VB the/DT secret/JJ ritual/NN in/IN the/DT basement/NN that/WDT had/VBD Sophie/NNP so/IN upset/JJ from/IN the/DT reader/NN ?/.
He/PRP kept/VBD that/IN from/IN us/PRP until/IN near/IN the/DT end/NN ./.
The/DT characters/NNS also/RB needed/VBD some/DT help/NN ./.
With/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN the/DT albino/NN monk/NN and/CC the/DT police/NN chief/NN ,/, the/DT characters/NNS were/VBD too/RB good/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ good/JJ ,/, and/CC failed/VBD to/TO react/VB in/IN a/DT believable/JJ manner/NN to/TO the/DT situation/NN ./.
No/DT one/NN had/VBD a/DT nervous/JJ breakdown/NN ,/, no/DT tempers/NNS flared/VBD ./.
If/IN it/PRP was/VBD me/PRP being/VBG interrogated/VBN by/IN the/DT police/NN and/CC someone/NN barged/VBD in/IN ,/, took/VBD the/DT bug/NN the/DT police/NN planted/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ jacket/NN and/CC tossed/VBD it/PRP into/IN a/DT moving/VBG truck/NN thereby/RB making/VBG it/PRP look/VB like/IN I/PRP was/VBD running/VBG ,/, a/DT fugitive/JJ ,/, and/CC therefore/RB guilty/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP might/MD be/VB just/RB a/DT little/JJ peeved/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT layout/NN of/IN the/DT story/NN ,/, the/DT imminent/JJ danger/NN they/PRP kept/VBD finding/VBG themselves/PRP in/IN ,/, and/CC the/DT amusing/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT puzzles/NNS carried/VBD the/DT book/NN ./.
I/PRP am/VBP looking/VBG forward/RB to/TO more/RBR from/IN Dan/NNP Brown/NNP ./.
Enjoy/VB ./.
