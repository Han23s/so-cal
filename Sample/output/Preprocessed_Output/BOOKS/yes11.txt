General/NNP Information/NNP When/WRB the/DT Wind/NN Blows/VBZ is/VBZ written/VBN by/IN author/NN James/NNP Patterson/NNP ./.
It/PRP was/VBD published/VBN in/IN 1998/CD by/IN Little/JJ ,/, Brown/JJ And/CC Company/NN ./.
The/DT hard/JJ cover/NN version/NN that/IN I/PRP read/VBP had/VBD a/DT total/NN of/IN 416/CD pages/NNS and/CC unlike/IN the/DT other/JJ two/CD books/NNS I/PRP 've/VBP read/VBN by/IN Patterson/NNP ,/, I/PRP could/MD actually/RB find/VB places/NNS where/WRB I/PRP could/MD force/VB myself/PRP to/TO stop/VB reading/VBG for/IN the/DT night/NN ./.
I/PRP 've/VBP only/RB recently/RB started/VBD reading/VBG books/NNS he/PRP 's/VBZ written/VBN and/CC confess/VBP that/IN I/PRP 'm/VBP already/RB a/DT huge/JJ fan/NN ./.
ISBN/NNP :/: 0-316-69332-4/CD The/DT Story/NNP Dr./NNP Frances/NNP O'Neill/NNP ,/, a/DT well/RB loved/VBN vet/NN in/IN Colorado/NNP ,/, was/VBD working/VBG as/RB usual/JJ in/IN her/PRP$ place/NN of/IN business/NN -/: the/DT Inn/NNP Patient/NN ./.
Frannie/NNP as/IN she/PRP 's/VBZ called/VBN by/IN her/PRP$ friends/NNS ,/, has/VBZ had/VBN her/PRP$ share/NN of/IN heart/NN break/NN and/CC loss/NN ./.
Her/PRP$ husband/NN David/NNP ,/, a/DT doctor/NN at/IN the/DT local/JJ hospital/NN was/VBD murdered/VBN less/JJR than/IN 2/CD years/NNS earlier/RBR ./.
Frannie/NNP is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ softy/NN which/WDT is/VBZ what/WP many/DT of/IN her/PRP$ clients/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ owners/NNS loved/VBD about/IN her/PRP ./.
So/RB there/EX she/PRP was/VBD ,/, minding/VBG her/PRP$ own/JJ business/NN when/WRB one/CD day/NN this/DT gorgeous/JJ hunk/NN of/IN man/NN walks/VBZ in/IN and/CC rents/VBZ her/PRP$ cabin/NN [/-LRB- which/WDT is/VBZ being/VBG the/DT Inn/NNP Patient/NN ]/-RRB- ./.
His/PRP$ name/NN is/VBZ Kit/NN Harrison/NNP and/CC while/IN she/PRP ca/MD n't/RB stand/VB him/PRP and/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN she/PRP ca/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC like/VB him/PRP -/: just/RB a/DT little/JJ ./.
It/PRP takes/VBZ quite/RB awhile/RB for/IN Frannie/NNP to/TO find/VB out/RP but/CC Kit/NN is/VBZ not/RB who/WP she/PRP thinks/VBZ he/PRP is/VBZ ./.
Then/RB ,/, Frannie/NNP 's/POS good/JJ friends/NNS husband/NN is/VBZ killed/VBN ./.
They/PRP say/VBP it/PRP was/VBD an/DT accident/NN ,/, that/IN he/PRP hit/VBD his/PRP$ head/NN in/IN the/DT pool/NN ;/: but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ very/RB hard/JJ for/IN those/DT who/WP knew/VBD him/PRP to/TO believe/VB ./.
After/IN much/JJ crying/VBG and/CC several/JJ drinks/NNS ,/, Frannie/NNP drives/VBZ back/RB home/NN to/TO the/DT Inn/NNP Patient/NN where/WRB she/PRP not/RB only/RB works/VBZ ,/, but/CC has/VBZ lived/VBN ever/RB since/IN David/NNP 's/POS death/NN ./.
On/IN her/PRP$ drive/NN home/NN she/PRP thinks/VBZ she/PRP sees/VBZ something/NN ./.
She/PRP stops/VBZ the/DT car/NN ./.
Wait/VB ./.
What/WP is/VBZ that/IN ?/.
Oh/UH my/PRP$ God/NNP !/.
It/PRP looks/VBZ like/IN a/DT human/JJ girl/NN ./.
A/DT beautiful/JJ little/JJ human/JJ girl/NN -/: no/RB more/JJR than/IN 12/CD years/NNS old/JJ ./.
But/CC she/PRP has/VBZ wings/NNS .../: and/CC oh/UH my/PRP$ God/NNP !/.
She/PRP can/MD fly/VB !/.
Frannie/NNP tries/VBZ to/TO gain/VB her/PRP$ composure/NN and/CC then/RB resumes/VBZ the/DT drive/NN home/NN ./.
By/IN the/DT time/NN she/PRP reaches/VBZ the/DT Inn/NNP Patient/NN she/PRP 's/VBZ convinced/JJ herself/PRP that/IN she/PRP could/MD n't/RB have/VB really/RB seen/VBN a/DT girl/NN with/IN wings/NNS ./.
It/PRP just/RB was/VBD n't/RB possible/JJ ./.
It/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN the/DT alcohol/NN ...../: ./.
right/RB ?/.
That/DT 's/VBZ all/DT I/PRP 'll/MD give/VB you/PRP for/IN the/DT story/NN ./.
Sorry/JJ ,/, but/CC if/IN I/PRP give/VBP you/PRP more/JJR than/IN that/IN I/PRP just/RB may/MD ruin/VB the/DT book/NN for/IN you/PRP ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ how/WRB Patterson/NNP writes/VBZ ./.
And/CC in/IN case/NN you/PRP 're/VBP wondering/VBG all/DT of/IN this/DT happens/VBZ in/IN the/DT first/JJ few/JJ chapters/NNS of/IN the/DT book/NN !/.
About/IN the/DT writing/VBG Like/IN every/DT other/JJ book/NN I/PRP 've/VBP read/VBN by/IN Patterson/NNP ,/, When/WRB the/DT Wind/NN Blows/NNS was/VBD thrilling/JJ and/CC very/RB hard/JJ to/TO put/VB down/RP -/: making/VBG it/PRP very/RB easy/JJ to/TO read/VB ./.
Patterson/NNP captivates/VBZ the/DT reader/NN from/IN page/NN one/CD and/CC if/IN you/PRP think/VBP you/PRP 'll/MD find/VB a/DT stopping/VBG place/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN a/DT chapter/NN -/: think/VB again/RB !/.
Unlike/IN the/DT last/JJ book/NN I/PRP read/VBP by/IN Patterson/NNP Cradle/NNP and/CC All/NNP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD actually/RB able/JJ to/TO put/VB down/RP When/WRB the/DT Wind/NN Blows/VBZ so/IN I/PRP could/MD get/VB some/DT sleep/NN ./.
It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB easy/JJ but/CC I/PRP did/VBD manage/VB ./.
In/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT book/NN is/VBZ an/DT Author/NN 's/POS Note/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT note/NN ,/, Patterson/NNP states/VBZ that/IN what/WP he/PRP writes/VBZ in/IN When/WRB the/DT Wind/NN Blows/VBZ is/VBZ much/RB closer/JJR to/TO the/DT truth/NN than/IN even/RB he/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB ./.
While/IN in/IN part/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP a/DT hard/JJ time/NN believing/VBG that/IN -/: there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT part/NN of/IN me/PRP that/IN knows/VBZ there/EX must/MD be/VB some/DT truth/NN to/TO the/DT matter/NN ./.
Overall/JJ If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP looking/VBG for/IN an/DT exciting/JJ book/NN of/IN fiction/NN and/CC science/NN and/CC doctors/NNS interest/NN you/PRP ,/, I/PRP recommend/VBP you/PRP give/VB When/WRB the/DT Wind/NN Blows/VBZ a/DT try/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP some/DT graphic/JJ parts/NNS which/WDT made/VBD me/PRP mad/JJ to/TO read/VB ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB believe/VB it/PRP would/MD be/VB too/RB much/JJ for/IN anyone/NN to/TO handle/VB ./.
Thanks/NNS for/IN reading/VBG ~/CD Melissa/NNP
