"/`` A/DT Painted/NNP House/NNP "/'' is/VBZ the/DT newest/JJS book/NN by/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ author/NN ,/, John/NNP Grisham/NNP ./.
As/RB soon/RB as/IN his/PRP$ books/NNS hit/VBD the/DT stands/NNS ,/, I/PRP have/VBP to/TO buy/VB them/PRP ./.
Even/RB if/IN I/PRP am/VBP in/IN the/DT middle/NN of/IN reading/VBG another/DT book/NN ,/, that/WDT book/NN gets/VBZ set/VBN aside/RB so/IN I/PRP can/MD read/VB his/PRP$ newest/JJS work/NN of/IN art/NN ./.
While/IN this/DT book/NN is/VBZ totally/RB different/JJ than/IN any/DT other/JJ book/NN he/PRP has/VBZ written/VBN to/TO date/NN ,/, it/PRP did/VBD not/RB disappoint/VB me/PRP at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP have/VBP read/VBN some/DT (/-LRB- few/JJ )/-RRB- reviews/VBZ that/IN did/VBD n't/RB rate/NN this/DT book/NN kindly/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP felt/VBD very/RB differently/RB ./.
While/IN I/PRP have/VBP loved/VBN every/DT one/CD of/IN Grisham/NNP 's/POS books/NNS ,/, sometimes/RB I/PRP have/VBP felt/VBN that/IN they/PRP were/VBD so/RB detailed/JJ and/CC technically/RB mind-boggling/JJ with/IN legal/JJ mumbo-jumbo/NN ./.
This/DT one/CD is/VBZ the/DT perfect/JJ change/NN of/IN pace/NN from/IN that/DT ./.
The/DT setting/NN is/VBZ Arkansas/NNP ,/, late/JJ summer/NN of/IN 1952/CD ./.
Luke/NNP Chandler/NNP is/VBZ a/DT 7/CD year/NN old/JJ boy/NN who/WP is/VBZ an/DT only/RB child/NN ,/, living/VBG with/IN his/PRP$ parents/NNS in/IN his/PRP$ paternal/JJ grandparents/NNS home/NN on/IN their/PRP$ cotton/NN farm/NN ./.
They/PRP are/VBP very/RB poor/JJ farm/NN folk/NN and/CC every/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT family/NN has/VBZ to/TO work/VB hard/RB to/TO bring/VB in/IN the/DT precious/JJ cotton/NN crop/NN ;/: something/NN they/PRP plan/VBP for/IN and/CC depend/VB on/IN all/DT year/NN long/RB ./.
Luke/NNP 's/POS grandfather/NN (/-LRB- "/`` Pappy/NNP "/'' to/TO Luke/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, is/VBZ a/DT spirited/JJ man/NN who/WP does/VBZ n't/RB tolerate/VB nonsense/NN ./.
I/PRP get/VBP a/DT kick/NN out/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN he/PRP insists/VBZ that/IN his/PRP$ old/JJ truck/NN must/MD not/RB be/VB driven/VBN over/IN 37/CD mph/NN ./.
He/PRP worries/VBZ constantly/RB about/IN the/DT weather/NN and/CC how/WRB it/PRP will/MD affect/VB their/PRP$ crops/NNS ./.
When/WRB it/PRP 's/VBZ picking/VBG time/NN ,/, Pappy/NNP goes/VBZ to/TO town/NN to/TO hire/VB Mexicans/NNPS who/WP have/VBP arrived/VBN in/IN a/DT trailer/NN ,/, all/DT scrunched/VBD up/RB worse/JJR than/IN cattle/NNS ./.
He/PRP hires/VBZ 10/CD of/IN them/PRP to/TO work/VB the/DT cotton/NN fields/NNS ./.
On/IN the/DT same/JJ day/NN he/PRP also/RB hires/VBZ the/DT Spruill/NNP family/NN ./.
Families/NNS who/WP live/VBP in/IN the/DT Ozarks/NNPS and/CC are/VBP referred/VBN to/TO as/IN "/`` The/DT hill/NN people/NNS "/'' come/VB down/RP to/TO be/VB hired/VBN on/IN to/TO the/DT cotton/NN farms/NNS for/IN the/DT season/NN ./.
The/DT story/NN takes/VBZ us/PRP through/IN the/DT short/JJ season/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT ups/NNS and/CC downs/NNS this/DT poor/JJ family/NN goes/VBZ through/IN trying/VBG not/RB to/TO get/VB rich/JJ from/IN their/PRP$ labors/NNS ,/, but/CC just/RB to/TO break/VB even/RB so/IN they/PRP can/MD farm/VB another/DT year/NN ./.
This/DT has/VBZ some/DT meaning/NN to/TO me/PRP because/IN my/PRP$ Dad/NNP is/VBZ a/DT farmer/NN and/CC although/IN times/NNS are/VBP different/JJ now/RB than/IN they/PRP were/VBD 50-60/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, we/PRP knew/VBD plenty/NN of/IN years/NNS where/WRB there/EX was/VBD barely/RB enough/JJ to/TO scrape/VB by/IN and/CC feed/VB 5/CD kids/NNS ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ amazing/JJ how/WRB resourceful/JJ one/NN can/MD be/VB when/WRB the/DT situation/NN requires/VBZ it/PRP ./.
Along/IN with/IN the/DT Spruill/NNP family/NN comes/VBZ their/PRP$ 17/CD year/NN old/JJ daughter/NN ,/, Tally/NNP ./.
Luke/NNP at/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN 7/CD has/VBZ yet/RB to/TO discover/VB much/JJ about/IN women/NNS ,/, but/CC is/VBZ very/RB curious/JJ about/IN Tally/NNP ./.
He/PRP thinks/VBZ that/IN a/DT 10/CD year/NN age/NN difference/NN is/VBZ n't/RB too/RB much/JJ ./.
Hank/NNP Spruill/NNP is/VBZ the/DT oldest/JJS Spruill/NNP boy/NN and/CC he/PRP is/VBZ mean/JJ ./.
He/PRP gets/VBZ into/IN fights/NNS and/CC is/VBZ even/RB involved/VBN in/IN the/DT death/NN of/IN one/CD the/DT boys/NNS from/IN another/DT farm/NN ./.
The/DT youngest/JJS Spruill/NN member/NN is/VBZ a/DT young/JJ boy/NN named/VBN Trot/NNP ./.
Trot/NNP is/VBZ not/RB '/`` right/RB '/'' as/IN he/PRP has/VBZ some/DT physical/JJ disabilities/NNS ./.
(/-LRB- This/DT was/VBD before/IN the/DT days/NNS of/IN political/JJ correctness/NN ./. )/-RRB-
Trot/NNP would/MD play/VB a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT story/NN as/IN to/TO how/WRB the/DT book/NN got/VBD it/PRP 's/VBZ name/NN ./.
Along/IN with/IN the/DT Mexicans/NNPS comes/VBZ a/DT boy/NN named/VBN Cowboy/NNP ./.
He/PRP too/RB is/VBZ a/DT mean/JJ person/NN and/CC he/PRP and/CC Hank/NNP have/VBP their/PRP$ moment/NN late/RB in/IN the/DT book/NN ./.
Luke/NNP does/VBZ n't/RB like/VB Cowboy/NNP much/RB because/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ too/RB much/JJ interest/NN between/IN Cowboy/NNP and/CC Tally/NNP ./.
This/DT book/NN has/VBZ reality/NN ,/, humor/NN ,/, scandal/NN ,/, sorrow/NN and/CC sentiment/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ written/VBN through/IN the/DT eyes/NNS of/IN a/DT seven/CD year/NN old/JJ boy/NN and/CC how/WRB he/PRP views/VBZ the/DT world/NN ./.
While/IN there/EX are/VBP parts/NNS in/IN the/DT book/NN that/WDT are/VBP disturbing/JJ because/IN there/EX is/VBZ death/NN or/CC financial/JJ tragedy/NN ,/, I/PRP found/VBD the/DT book/NN to/TO be/VB light/JJ hearted/JJ and/CC often/RB funny/JJ ./.
Grisham/NNP had/VBD a/DT way/NN of/IN making/VBG Luke/NNP 's/POS character/NN quite/RB interesting/JJ ;/: very/RB inquisitive/JJ and/CC hugely/RB imaginitive/JJ was/VBD young/JJ Luke/NNP ./.
If/IN I/PRP had/VBD to/TO choose/VB something/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBN to/TO be/VB different/JJ about/IN the/DT book/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP ,/, as/IN others/NNS have/VBP mentioned/VBN ,/, that/IN I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBN to/TO know/VB more/JJR at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT book/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN what/WP happens/VBZ to/TO the/DT family/NN ./.
But/CC then/RB ,/, this/DT book/NN ca/MD n't/RB go/VB on/IN forever/RB ./.
All/DT things/NNS considered/VBN ,/, I/PRP think/VBP the/DT author/NN chose/VBD an/DT appropriate/JJ place/NN to/TO end/VB the/DT book/NN ./.
