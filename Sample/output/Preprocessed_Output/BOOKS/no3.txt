A/DT few/JJ days/NNS ago/IN my/PRP$ husband/NN and/CC I/PRP crawled/VBD into/IN bed/NN and/CC I/PRP decided/VBD I/PRP would/MD start/VB my/PRP$ new/JJ John/NNP Grisham/NNP book/NN ,/, A/DT Painted/NNP House/NNP ,/, before/IN falling/VBG asleep/RB ./.
I/PRP am/VBP a/DT John/NNP Grisham/NNP fan/NN and/CC I/PRP always/RB rush/VBP out/RP and/CC buy/VB his/PRP$ books/NNS as/RB soon/RB as/IN they/PRP come/VBP out/RP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ sort/NN of/IN an/DT indulgence/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO pay/VB the/DT price/NN for/IN a/DT hard/JJ bound/VBN book/NN but/CC I/PRP enjoy/VBP his/PRP$ storytelling/NN and/CC since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ usually/RB a/DT once/year/JJ indulgence/NN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB ./.
Lying/VBG in/IN bed/NN I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO annoy/VB my/PRP$ husband/NN and/CC I/PRP began/VBD reading/VBG the/DT book/NN aloud/RB ./.
I/PRP did/VBD this/DT for/IN about/RB 4/CD minutes/NNS with/IN him/PRP saying/VBG nothing/NN ./.
I/PRP then/RB asked/VBD if/IN I/PRP was/VBD bothering/VBG him/PRP ,/, and/CC he/PRP said/VBD "/`` Nope/UH ,/, just/RB wondering/VBG how/WRB long/RB you/PRP will/MD keep/VB reading/VBG to/TO me/PRP ./. "/''
I/PRP took/VBD that/DT as/IN a/DT challenge/NN to/TO continue/VB and/CC did/VBD so/RB for/IN another/DT 5/CD minutes/NNS ./.
When/WRB I/PRP stopped/VBD reading/VBG my/PRP$ husband/NN laughed/VBD and/CC said/VBD "/`` That/DT is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS boring/JJ book/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB heard/VBN "/'' ./.
I/PRP shrugged/VBD it/PRP off/RP since/IN it/PRP was/VBD just/RB the/DT beginning/NN ./.
I/PRP should/MD have/VB listened/VBN to/TO my/PRP$ husband/NN and/CC put/VBD the/DT book/NN down/RB ./.
A/DT Painted/NNP House/NNP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT typical/JJ legal/JJ thriller/NN from/IN John/NNP Grisham/NNP ./.
Instead/RB this/DT is/VBZ the/DT tale/NN of/IN Luke/NNP Chandler/NNP and/CC his/PRP$ family/NN ./.
The/DT story/NN takes/VBZ place/NN in/IN the/DT 50/CD 's/POS and/CC does/VBZ transport/VB you/PRP back/RB to/TO that/DT era/NN ./.
Grisham/NNP does/VBZ a/DT fine/JJ job/NN of/IN describing/VBG the/DT time/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, in/IN other/JJ areas/NNS the/DT book/NN just/RB falls/VBZ flat/JJ on/IN its/PRP$ face/NN ./.
Luke/NNP Chandler/NNP lives/VBZ on/IN a/DT cotton/NN farm/NN in/IN Arkansas/NNP with/IN his/PRP$ Mom/NN ,/, Dad/NNP ,/, Grandma/NNP ,/, and/CC Grandpa/NN in/IN an/DT unpainted/JJ house/NN ./.
Each/DT year/NN during/IN the/DT cotton/NN picking/VBG season/NN the/DT family/NN goes/VBZ into/IN town/NN and/CC selects/VBZ its/PRP$ help/NN for/IN the/DT season/NN ./.
This/DT year/NN the/DT family/NN selects/VBZ the/DT Spruills/NNP ,/, a/DT family/NN from/IN the/DT hills/NNS of/IN Arkansas/NNP and/CC a/DT group/NN of/IN Mexicans/NNPS ./.
Things/NNS are/VBP different/JJ this/DT time/NN around/IN and/CC right/RB from/IN the/DT beginning/VBG the/DT Chandlers/NNPS do/VBP n't/RB seem/VB to/TO care/VB for/IN the/DT Spruills/NNS but/CC they/PRP need/VBP the/DT help/NN so/IN they/PRP do/VBP whatever/WDT they/PRP can/MD to/TO keep/VB the/DT peace/NN ./.
The/DT Spruills/NNS have/VBP a/DT son/NN who/WP is/VBZ a/DT rather/RB large/JJ bully/NN and/CC seems/VBZ to/TO enjoy/VB that/DT ./.
He/PRP causes/VBZ trouble/NN on/IN the/DT farm/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN in/IN town/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO ruin/VB the/DT story/NN so/IN I/PRP will/MD just/RB say/VB that/IN there/EX are/VBP some/DT things/NNS that/WDT happen/VB and/CC Luke/NNP seems/VBZ to/TO bear/VB witness/NN to/TO all/DT of/IN them/PRP ./.
This/DT probably/RB is/VBZ because/IN the/DT child/NN ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ 7/CD ,/, is/VBZ somewhat/RB of/IN a/DT voyeur/NN ./.
Perhaps/RB it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT boring/JJ life/NN on/IN the/DT cotton/NN farm/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT boy/NN just/RB seems/VBZ to/TO enjoy/VB sneaking/VBG around/RB into/IN everyone/NN 's/POS business/NN ./.
He/PRP sees/VBZ some/DT things/NNS that/IN no/DT child/NN should/MD see/VB and/CC is/VBZ more/RBR or/CC less/RBR forced/VBN to/TO keep/VB a/DT series/NN of/IN secrets/NNS from/IN everyone/NN ./.
The/DT story/NN starts/VBZ of/IN slowly/RB ,/, and/CC when/WRB I/PRP say/VBP slowly/RB ,/, I/PRP mean/VBP very/RB slowly/RB ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB there/EX is/VBZ any/DT action/NN of/IN excitement/NN until/IN around/IN page/NN 70/CD ,/, give/VBP or/CC take/VBP a/DT few/JJ ./.
Grisham/NNP really/RB seems/VBZ to/TO take/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN setting/VBG the/DT scene/NN and/CC developing/VBG the/DT characters/NNS ./.
There/EX are/VBP authors/NNS that/WDT neglect/NN to/TO do/VB this/DT but/CC I/PRP felt/VBD Grisham/NNP really/RB took/VBD too/RB much/JJ time/NN here/RB ./.
I/PRP had/VBD a/DT hard/JJ time/NN getting/VBG into/IN the/DT book/NN and/CC at/IN one/CD point/NN found/VBD myself/PRP thinking/VBG things/NNS were/VBD picking/VBG up/RP ./.
I/PRP got/VBD a/DT little/JJ excited/JJ that/IN things/NNS were/VBD looking/VBG up/RP only/RB to/TO find/VB out/RP that/IN it/PRP really/RB was/VBD nothing/NN ./.
When/WRB the/DT story/NN does/VBZ finally/RB pick/VB up/RP a/DT little/JJ bit/NN it/PRP is/VBZ only/RB temporary/JJ ./.
Up/IN we/PRP go/VBP and/CC right/RB back/RB down/RB ./.
I/PRP told/VBD my/PRP$ husband/NN there/EX is/VBZ about/IN 30/CD pages/NNS of/IN boring/NN and/CC then/RB about/IN 3/CD pages/NNS of/IN excitement/NN ./.
I/PRP found/VBD it/PRP to/TO be/VB rather/RB annoying/JJ ./.
I/PRP guess/VBP that/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ major/JJ issue/NN with/IN this/DT book/NN ./.
I/PRP knew/VBD when/WRB I/PRP purchased/VBD this/DT book/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB a/DT legal/JJ thriller/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP still/RB hoped/VBD for/IN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN mystery/NN ,/, there/EX was/VBD none/NN !/.
The/DT ending/VBG is/VBZ another/DT thing/NN that/WDT falls/VBZ flat/JJ ./.
There/EX were/VBD so/RB many/JJ different/JJ roads/NNS that/IN this/DT ending/VBG could/MD have/VB taken/VBN and/CC although/IN the/DT ending/VBG was/VBD a/DT happy/JJ one/CD ,/, it/PRP was/VBD also/RB a/DT little/JJ sad/JJ and/CC I/PRP felt/VBD let/VB down/RP ./.
I/PRP am/VBP not/RB impressed/VBN with/IN this/DT particular/JJ Grisham/NNP novel/NN ./.
I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN Grisham/NNP spent/VBD too/RB much/JJ time/NN on/IN the/DT character/NN development/NN and/CC not/RB enough/JJ time/NN making/VBG the/DT story/NN exciting/JJ for/IN the/DT reader/NN ./.
His/PRP$ description/NN of/IN the/DT 50/CD 's/POS seems/VBZ accurate/JJ and/CC readers/NNS might/MD enjoy/VB the/DT trip/NN back/RB in/IN time/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN trip/NN does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB the/DT book/NN worth/JJ reading/NN ./.
