I/PRP have/VBP read/VBN all/DT of/IN Grisham/NNP 's/POS books/NNS and/CC this/DT was/VBD by/IN far/RB the/DT most/RBS boring/JJ one/CD !/.
The/DT story/NN is/VBZ about/IN a/DT lawyer/NN who/WP gives/VBZ up/RP his/PRP$ high/JJ paying/VBG job/NN to/TO help/VB the/DT homeless/NN in/IN an/DT office/NN staffed/VBN by/IN 2/CD other/JJ people/NNS ./.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT mystery/NN to/TO the/DT story/NN ./.
Grisham/NNP 's/POS books/NNS are/VBP normally/RB mysterious/JJ ,/, ca/MD n't/RB wait/VB to/TO finish/VB it/PRP ,/, a/DT "/`` who/WP done/VBD it/PRP "/'' style/NN ./.
This/DT book/NN does/VBZ not/RB have/VB any/DT surprises/NNS ,/, its/PRP$ dull/JJ ./.
I/PRP expected/VBD a/DT book/NN like/IN other/JJ books/NNS (/-LRB- f.i./NN Pelican/NNP Brief/JJ etc/NN )/-RRB- he/PRP has/VBZ written/VBN ./.
It/PRP definitely/RB was/VBD not/RB !/.
