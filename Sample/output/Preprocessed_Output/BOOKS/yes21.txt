I/PRP am/VBP a/DT slow/JJ reader/NN ,/, but/CC compared/VBN to/TO my/PRP$ husband/NN ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP a/DT veritable/JJ Speedy/NNP Gonazalez/NNP ./.
He/PRP starts/VBZ a/DT book/NN and/CC ,/, if/IN he/PRP 's/VBZ really/RB interested/JJ ,/, he/PRP finishes/VBZ it/PRP three/CD weeks/NNS later/RB ./.
So/RB when/WRB he/PRP finished/VBD reading/VBG The/DT Da/NN Vinci/NNP code/NN in/IN three/CD days/NNS ,/, I/PRP was/VBD impressed/JJ ./.
"/`` I/PRP could/MD n't/RB help/VB it/PRP !/. "/''
my/PRP$ husband/NN said/VBD ./.
"/`` It/PRP just/RB sucks/VBZ you/PRP in/IN ./.
I/PRP started/VBD and/CC before/IN I/PRP knew/VBD it/PRP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD halfway/RB done/VBN ./.
You/PRP should/MD read/VB it/PRP !/. "/''
I/PRP was/VBD surprised/VBN ./.
While/IN my/PRP$ husband/NN is/VBZ fully/RB supportive/JJ of/IN my/PRP$ book/NN habit/NN ,/, he/PRP rarely/RB goes/VBZ down/IN the/DT "/`` you/PRP should/MD read/VB it/PRP "/'' path/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO his/PRP$ books/NNS that/IN he/PRP likes/VBZ ./.
His/PRP$ attempt/NN to/TO get/VB me/PRP to/TO appreciate/VB Tom/NNP Clancy/NNP ended/VBD in/IN loud/JJ snores/NNS on/IN my/PRP$ part/NN ./.
The/DT covers/NNS of/IN his/PRP$ many/JJ sci/FW fi/FW books/NNS all/DT seem/VBP pretty/RB much/RB the/DT same/JJ to/TO me/PRP ./.
And/CC I/PRP am/VBP rarely/RB tempted/VBN to/TO snatch/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT books/NNS off/IN his/PRP$ "/`` to/TO read/VB "/'' pile/NN and/CC sneak/VB it/PRP into/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN some/DT classics/NNS from/IN Tolkein/NNP and/CC C./NNP S./NNP Lewis/NNP and/CC a/DT few/JJ others/NNS ,/, we/PRP very/RB rarely/RB swap/NN books/NNS ./.
I/PRP know/VBP him/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ tastes/NNS (/-LRB- and/CC he/PRP mine/NN )/-RRB- well/RB enough/RB to/TO know/VB that/IN he/PRP would/MD n't/RB insist/VB that/IN I/PRP read/VBP the/DT book/NN unless/IN he/PRP really/RB believed/VBD I/PRP would/MD like/VB it/PRP ./.
Got/NNP to/TO hand/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT man/NN ./.
Thirteen/CD years/NNS of/IN marriage/NN have/VBP n't/RB been/VBN lost/VBN on/IN him/PRP ./.
He/PRP was/VBD right/JJ !/.
The/DT Da/NN Vinci/NNP Code/NNP starts/VBZ off/RP with/IN a/DT bang/NN ./.
Jacques/NNP Sauniere/NNP ,/, curator/NN of/IN the/DT Louvre/NNP Museum/NNP ,/, is/VBZ trying/VBG desperately/RB to/TO escape/VB his/PRP$ attacker/NN ./.
Grabbing/VBG a/DT painting/NN off/IN the/DT wall/NN ,/, Sauniere/NNP trips/NNS the/DT security/NN gates/NNS ,/, which/WDT close/RB behind/IN him/PRP ./.
Still/RB ,/, his/PRP$ attacker/NN catches/VBZ him/PRP anyway/RB and/CC shoots/VBZ him/PRP through/IN the/DT gaps/NNS in/IN the/DT gate/NN ./.
Sauniere/NNP knows/VBZ that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ dying/VBG ,/, and/CC he/PRP knows/VBZ that/IN he/PRP alone/RB holds/VBZ an/DT important/JJ secret/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN passed/VBN down/RP through/IN generations/NNS ./.
So/RB in/IN what/WP he/PRP knows/VBZ are/VBP his/PRP$ last/JJ minutes/NNS of/IN life/NN ,/, he/PRP finds/VBZ a/DT way/NN to/TO leave/VB clues/NNS to/TO the/DT secret/NN for/IN the/DT one/CD person/NN that/IN he/PRP knows/VBZ can/MD be/VB trusted/VBN with/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT chief/JJ suspect/NN in/IN Sauniere/NNP 's/POS murder/NN is/VBZ American/JJ symbologist/NN Robert/NNP Langdon/NNP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ in/IN Paris/NNP to/TO give/VB some/DT lectures/VBZ at/IN the/DT American/NNP University/NNP in/IN Paris/NNP and/CC who/WP was/VBD scheduled/VBN to/TO meet/VB Sauniere/NNP that/IN evening/NN ./.
Agent/NNP Sophie/NNP Nevue/NNP ,/, a/DT cryptologist/NN for/IN the/DT Paris/NNP police/NN ,/, is/VBZ unconvinced/JJ of/IN his/PRP$ guilt/NN ./.
Together/RB ,/, they/PRP flee/VBP from/IN the/DT police/NN interrogation/NN and/CC start/VB to/TO decipher/VB the/DT clues/NNS to/TO discover/VB why/WRB Sauniere/NNP was/VBD killed/VBN and/CC to/TO figure/VB out/RP Sauniere/NNP 's/POS secret/NN ./.
They/PRP are/VBP pursued/VBN by/IN an/DT overzealous/JJ police/NN captain/NN ,/, the/DT albino/NN monk/NN ,/, a/DT scheming/JJ bishop/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT mysterious/JJ man/NN known/VBN only/RB as/IN "/`` the/DT Teacher/NN "/'' ./.
As/IN my/PRP$ husband/NN pointed/VBD out/RP ,/, the/DT story/NN moves/VBZ along/IN at/IN a/DT fast/JJ pace/NN ./.
The/DT chapters/NNS are/VBP short/JJ (/-LRB- sometimes/RB less/JJR than/IN a/DT page/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Author/NN Dan/NNP Brown/NNP rarely/RB deviates/VBZ from/IN the/DT mystery/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT flowery/JJ dialog/NN ,/, and/CC time/NN is/VBZ n't/RB wasted/VBN trying/VBG to/TO establish/VB a/DT hot/JJ relationship/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD lead/NN characters/NNS ./.
Since/IN the/DT storyline/NN covers/VBZ a/DT period/NN of/IN less/JJR than/IN 24/CD hours/NNS ,/, there/EX really/RB is/VBZ n't/RB much/JJ time/NN for/IN that/DT romantic/JJ schlock/NN ./.
But/CC that/DT 's/VBZ OK/JJ ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ far/RB more/RBR believable/JJ without/IN it/PRP !/.
The/DT Da/NN Vinci/NNP Code/NNP is/VBZ what/WDT my/PRP$ husband/NN calls/VBZ "/`` a/DT geek/NN book/NN "/'' or/CC ,/, to/TO be/VB more/RBR exact/JJ ,/, "/`` a/DT geek/NN mystery/NN ./. "/''
Rather/RB than/IN relying/VBG on/IN conventional/JJ clues/NNS (/-LRB- like/IN footprints/NNS in/IN the/DT flowerbed/VBN ,/, lipstick/NN on/IN the/DT collar/NN ,/, and/CC fingerprints/NNS on/IN the/DT wine/NN glass/NN )/-RRB- ,/, the/DT mystery/NN follows/VBZ a/DT trail/NN of/IN riddles/NNS and/CC symbols/NNS ./.
Many/JJ of/IN these/DT riddles/NNS are/VBP based/VBN in/IN history/NN and/CC are/VBP encrypted/VBN using/VBG a/DT variety/NN of/IN techniques/NNS ./.
Mathematicians/NNS are/VBP sure/JJ to/TO love/VB this/DT book/NN !/.
I/PRP enjoyed/VBD it/PRP because/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT clues/NNS involved/VBD two/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/JJ subjects/NNS :/: art/NN history/NN and/CC theology/NN ./.
According/VBG to/TO a/DT one-page/JJ intro/NN ,/, The/DT Da/NN Vinci/NNP Code/NNP involves/VBZ actual/JJ groups/NNS and/CC historical/JJ events/NNS ./.
The/DT Catholic/NNP Church/NNP ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ enough/RB public/JJ embarrassments/NNS to/TO make/VB it/PRP a/DT viable/JJ topic/NN for/IN any/DT mystery/NN novel/NN ,/, and/CC Opus/NNP Dei/NNP ,/, which/WDT received/VBD much/JJ attention/NN due/JJ to/TO FBI/NNP spy/NN Robert/NNP Hanssen/NNP ,/, figure/NN prominently/RB into/IN the/DT plot/NN ./.
Toss/VB in/IN lots/NNS of/IN talk/NN about/IN the/DT Priory/NNP of/IN Sion/NNP and/CC Leonardo/NNP da/NNP Vinci/NNP 's/POS use/NN of/IN symbolism/NN in/IN his/PRP$ art/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP have/VBP a/DT conspiracy/NN theorist/NN 's/POS wet/JJ dream/NN ./.
This/DT leads/VBZ to/TO my/PRP$ one/CD caution/NN about/IN this/DT book/NN ./.
The/DT Da/NN Vinci/NNP Code/NNP presents/VBZ some/DT alternative/JJ interpretations/NNS of/IN religious/JJ history/NN and/CC involves/VBZ paganism/NN ./.
Ultra-conservative/JJ Christians/NNS (/-LRB- or/CC those/DT who/WP are/VBP n't/RB secure/VB in/IN what/WP they/PRP believe/VBP )/-RRB- may/MD want/VB to/TO steer/VB clear/JJ of/IN this/DT one/CD ./.
Since/IN I/PRP finished/VBD The/DT Da/NN Vinci/NNP Code/NNP ,/, I/PRP 've/VBP discovered/VBN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ n't/RB the/DT first/JJ Dan/NNP Brown/NNP novel/NN in/IN which/WDT Robert/NNP Langdon/NNP has/VBZ appeared/VBN ,/, nor/CC will/MD it/PRP be/VB the/DT last/JJ ./.
Langdon/NNP first/RB appeared/VBD in/IN Angels/NNPS and/CC Demons/NNPS (/-LRB- 2001/CD )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC Brown/JJ plans/NNS to/TO write/VB more/JJR books/NNS with/IN Langdon/NNP in/IN them/PRP ./.
Lucky/JJ for/IN us/PRP geeks/NNS !/.
The/DT Da/NN Vinci/NNP Code/NNP really/RB is/VBZ a/DT terrific/JJ book/NN ./.
While/IN I/PRP figured/VBD out/RP some/DT of/IN the/DT clues/NNS before/IN the/DT characters/NNS in/IN the/DT book/NN did/VBD ,/, I/PRP was/VBD still/RB surprised/JJ and/CC fascinated/VBN throughout/IN the/DT book/NN ./.
Take/VB my/PRP$ advice/NN ./.
Heck/NN ,/, take/VB my/PRP$ husband/NN 's/POS !/.
Read/VB it/PRP !/.
